  For my CS50 final I made a program in python called Jeff Invaders. I
made it in Thonny IDE, and used the pygame modual. The only import is pygame. The
background to this game comes from me and my neighbor's boat trip last summer.
Anyway, long story short. He fell in the drink, and lost a flip flop. I got
such a kick out of this, that I made a game about the event. That evening we
stayed up finding the best pics off his facebook page, and I found some game
graphics for the explosions. I stayed up late working on it and got the basic
outline of the game done. Then I added the player sprites and mobs. At this point,
it was actually looking like a game. Once I got it functioning (for the most part)
I let Jeff's dad play it. Now I have to figure out how to make an .exe file
so he can shoot flip flops at his boy all day. At least sombody gets a kick out of
it. I've seen alot of games made with pygame that only let you move around with
the arrow keys. I wanted to make a game that utilizes the mouse. With quite a
bit of research, I finally implemented it into the game. I changed the fire
button from left mouse click to the scroll wheel, and ended up deciding on just
having it on autofire. For the explosions, I made an array of list's for each size
explosion. I used (Kenny's game assets) for the explosion annimation, and sounds.
All the graphics and sound files are open source. Jeff gave me all the pictures
of the jeep from his facebook page. When I went to make the highscore system, I
had a problem saving the file. I kept trying to save it as an (int) instead of a
(str). I knew from the lectures how to do it, but it wasn't till I looked right at
at it that I realized my mistake. I have alot of extra files that I dont need in
the project folder, so I should probably delete some of those. With that design 
decision made, I wanted to make some kind of level system.I created the sheild 
bar so when it reaches 0, the game ends. This worked, but became booring quick. 
To make it more challenging I made it so the game spawns more Jeff's every time 
you get hit. I think I put three groups of mobs out every time you get hit by one 
of those pesky Jeffs. Everything seemed fine, and I let my nephew play. He seemed to 
love it so much, He wants to know my high score every time I see him. So I had to 
put a highscore system in. I also put another splash screen in, if you get a high 
score it says "High Score".  I would like to make levels in the future, and to be able 
to put your name in for the high score. I would also like to incorporate some kind 
of animation at the splash screen. I was thinking about making the tires look like 
they are shooting sand out from behind the Jeep. Anyway, this has been my final for CS50.
